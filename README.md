# Yugo Puzzle Solver

This is a simple puzzle solver for the [Yugo puzzle](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693260/Yugo_Puzzle/).
It uses depth-first search to find a possible solution.

I actually created this because I couldn't solve certain levels ðŸ˜­, so it does not support all levels.

## Usage

``` bash
$ cat example.txt | cargo run --release > result.txt
```
